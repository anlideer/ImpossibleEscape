Engine version: 5.0.3 (I don't think ue5 provides a very good experience though)


Unfortunately, I have to replace the experimental feature (Geometry Script https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/geometry-script-users-guide/) I use with plain cubes when packaging, because experimental stuffs refuse to show up whatever packaging option I chose.
